        o Save for hour - a calendar with free dates and times is displayed. 

        o The appointment for an hour is every 30 minutes, and the dentist enters the work schedule himself with time in the system; 

        o After an appointment, both the patient and the dentist are notified by email, as 1 an hour before the hour the system has to
          send an email again (crown pocket of the server must be set up); 

        o A patient can cancel an hour, which is possible 1 hour before the event, otherwise a review fee is charged. He is going to 
        the dentist notify by e-mail; 
        
        o A dentist can also cancel an hour by notifying the patient mail; 

        o Change of personal data; 

        o History of reserved hours; 

        o Examination of personal ambulatory card with performed manipulations; 

• User menu for dentist: 

        o calendar with reserved hours; 

        o list of patients; 

        o Sorting and searching for patients with different criteria (most regular, name, rating, manipulations); 

        o Annuity of an hour; 

        o Notifications for new recorded hours; 

        o History of the performed manipulations; 

        o And others. 

 

• Calendar with special events - overview, promotions, campaigns; 

• Ability to add a comment to each event; 

• Evaluation by a doctor; 

• Patient assessment; 

• Comments to each doctor; 

• Overall rating of dentists;

quickly and easily make an appointment for it.
